              School can be an overwhelming experience for children with Autism. Transitioning from their familiar environment to a shared space can be challenging for them.

If your child shows reluctance to go to school, it's crucial to address it early on. Here are some strategies you can try at home:
<ol>
<li> Encourage open communication with your child about the issue. Visual supports can be helpful. Ask your child to rate events or places at school on a scale from "not scary" to "very scary." This can help you identify when and where the problems occur and build your child's resilience.
</li>
<li> If you understand the reasons behind their reluctance, communicate them to the school staff.
</li>
<li> Create a "worry book" for your child to document their anxieties during the school day. If appropriate, read the book together as part of their evening routine. This allows you to help them address any worries and suggest coping strategies for the future.
</li>
<li> Explore strategies to regulate, reduce, and monitor emotions and stress, such as incorporating exercise or using visual stress scales like a stress thermometer or traffic light system.
</li>
<li> Recognize and praise any progress your child makes on specific tasks, such as completing challenging assignments, wearing their school uniform, or walking past the school.
</li>
<li>Establish structure at home by using visual supports.
</li> 
<li> Assist your child in developing their social skills.</li>

<li> Help them understand the benefits of education and its importance.</li>
</ol>
By implementing these strategies, you can support your child in navigating the challenges of school and promote their overall well-being.
