            <p>Mastering the process of getting dressed is an essential aspect of daily life and a crucial life competency. Achieving success in this area relies on establishing a routine and maintaining consistency. While not all children with autism possess the ability to dress themselves, as a parent, you possess the knowledge to determine the appropriate time to support your child in acquiring this skill.

               Teaching my autistic son how to dress required significant amounts of time, practice, and patience. The process of donning clothes in the correct order, fastening buttons and zippers, and tying shoelaces encompasses the mastery of numerous abilities. When sensory triggers are added to the equation, it becomes evident why it took him longer to develop dressing skills compared to his peers of the same age.
              <br>
              <br>
              Nevertheless, the endeavor is well worth it. The ability to dress independently instills confidence in autistic children, enabling them to function autonomously at school, and alleviates one less concern for you during the mornings!</p>
