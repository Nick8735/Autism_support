              <p>Incorporate structure and routine into mealtimes. Children with autism benefit from a predictable eating schedule, including three regular meals and two snacks each day. While water can be offered between meals, it's important to limit other foods and drinks outside of the scheduled eating times. <br>

                Continue to introduce less-preferred foods during meals. Removing these foods entirely prevents your child from having the opportunity to try new foods. Instead, consider including small amounts of new or nonpreferred foods, like a single green pea or half of a grape, on a separate plate. By offering smaller portions, you increase the likelihood of your child trying the food. If your child is still experiencing feeding difficulties, you can find more information about our Feeding Program.
                
                By following these tips, you can create a structured environment that encourages your child to explore new foods and expand their dietary choices. For additional resources and support, please visit</p></div>
